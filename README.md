## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd pillar_of_men
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set up environment variables or secrets:

Create `streamlit/secrets.toml`:
```toml
OPENAI_API_KEY = "your-openai-api-key"
SMTP_USERNAME = "your-email@gmail.com"
SMTP_PASSWORD = "your-app-password"
EMAIL_FROM = "your-email@gmail.com"
```

Or set environment variables:
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"
export SMTP_USERNAME="your-email@gmail.com"
export SMTP_PASSWORD="your-app-password"
export EMAIL_FROM="your-email@gmail.com"
```

## Usage

1. Run the Streamlit app:
```bash
streamlit run app/main.py
```

2. Navigate to the app in your browser (usually `http://localhost:8501`)

3. **Upload PDFs**: Go to "Upload PDFs" page and upload one or more PDF files

4. **Chat**: Use the "Chat" page to:
   - Ask questions about uploaded PDFs (RAG)
   - Make bookings by saying things like "I want to book a doctor appointment"
   - Search the web for information

5. **Admin Dashboard**: View all bookings, search by name/email/date, and see statistics

## Booking Flow

1. User expresses booking intent (e.g., "I want to book a doctor appointment")
2. Bot detects intent and starts collecting information:
   - Customer name
   - Email
   - Phone
   - Booking/service type
   - Preferred date (YYYY-MM-DD)
   - Preferred time (HH:MM, 24-hour format)
3. Bot extracts information from user messages automatically
4. Bot asks for missing fields
5. Bot summarizes all details and asks for confirmation
6. On confirmation:
   - Booking is saved to SQLite database
   - Confirmation email is sent
   - Booking ID is provided

## Database Schema

### customers
- `customer_id` (PK)
- `name`
- `email` (unique)
- `phone`
- `created_at`

### bookings
- `id` (PK)
- `customer_id` (FK)
- `booking_type`
- `date`
- `time`
- `status`
- `created_at`
- `notes`

## Tools Implemented

1. **RAG Tool**: Retrieves relevant information from uploaded PDFs
2. **Booking Persistence Tool**: Saves bookings to SQLite database
3. **Email Tool**: Sends confirmation emails via SMTP
4. **Web Search Tool**: Searches the web using DuckDuckGo API

## Configuration

Edit `app/config.py` to customize:
- Chunk size and overlap for RAG
- Embedding and LLM models
- Memory size
- Vector store path
- Database path

## Deployment to Streamlit Cloud

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Go to [Streamlit Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud)
3. Connect your repository
4. Set secrets in Streamlit Cloud dashboard:
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY`
